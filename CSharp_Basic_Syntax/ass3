Create a Person class that represents a person with two properties:

Name: This should be an auto-implemented (shorthand) property.

Age: This should be a property in full format with validation logic in the set accessor:

The setter should ensure that the age is a positive integer. If an invalid value is provided (e.g., negative or zero), an ArgumentException should be thrown and the program should terminate without any further input.

In addition, you need to create a Program class with the Main method that:

Prompts the user to input a person's Name.

Prompts the user to input a person's Age.

If the age is valid, print the person's name and age.

If the age is invalid, catch the exception, display an error message, and terminate the program.

Example Input & Output:

Enter your name: Alice

Enter your age: 30

Name: Alice Age: 30

 

Enter your name: Alice

Enter your age: -5

Error: Age must be a positive number.
